    (*) Simple means they are standardised:
    [X] Have been @threadify-ied.
    [X] Get list[str] of IPv4 addresses as input (post-threadify).
    [X] Output list[bool] indicating online-ness of the addresses (index-correlated) (post-threadify).

    Note: index-correlatedness, lists as input, and lists as output are handled by @threadify.
    The requirements for the base function are just that it's of the form: `scan: str (IPv4 address) -> bool (connectivity)`.


    Args:
        scan (function): a @threadify-ied method from list[str] all_possible_addresses -> list[bool] online.
        all_possible_addresses (list[str]): a list of IPv4 to test connectivity to.
        results (bool, optional): Decides whether to print the results. Defaults to True.
        repeats (int, optional): How many times should the full-range of addresses be scanned? Defaults to 3.
