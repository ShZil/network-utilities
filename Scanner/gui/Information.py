        f"whereas links regarding real devices on the network are stored as dynamic ARP entries.",
        f"The ARP Cache, alongside the stateless nature of ARP,",
        f"is sometimes explioted by hackers to preform an `ARP Spoofing` attack on a device.",

        f"#### TCP Ports",
        f"A _port_ is a (usually 16-bit) number assigned to uniquely identify a connection endpoint and to direct data to a specific service.",
        f"At the software level, within an OS, a port is a logical construct to indentify a specific process or a type of network service.",
        f"#### Open / Closed TCP Ports",
        f"The term _open port_ is used to mean a TCP or UDP port number that is configured to accept packets.",
