Created folder ./Scanner
Created file main.py
Created file run.bat
    - `@echo off` to disable Batch echoing.
    - `color 0A` to set the colors to black (bg) and lime (fg).
    - `title Shzil Network Scanner` to set the CMD's title.
    - `python main.py %*` to activate `main.py`, with all the command line arguments (`%*`).
    - `pause` so the window doesn't automatically close on error.
Created file util.py

[ ] Packet building and sending. "Scratch-like packet building and sending and receiving"
[ ] Trace routes to outside computers.
[ ] Apply Graph Theory algorithms?
[ ] User actions
[ ] Move all my communication through another device? "Reroute all my packets through a different subnet computer [Wrong MAC, router IP]."
[ ] Algorithmically recognise attacks / show information to enable a human to indentify attacks
[ ] Virtual network creator
[ ] Record some activity and replay it later
[ ] DHCP as new device enters

[00:44] Found a website listing some network-related windows cmd commands,
maybe read the output of those too?
https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ten-windows-10-network-commands-everyone-one-should-know/
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-advanced-networking-commands/
http://support.seagate.com/rightnow/Flash/central_axis/IPCommands.pdf

[00:58] maybe switch to `ipconfig /allcompartments /all`, rewrite some parser and have possibly more info. Or maybe it doesn't give more info.

[01:02] DHCP testing could use command(s) `ipconfig /release & ipconfig /renew`
